Overview
========

You want to contribute to Nighres? That's fantastic! A few words to get started:

**You don't have to be an expert!**

Contributing to open source software is a great way of learning by doing, and others in the Nighres community will be happy to help you out if you have questions or get stuck.

**What to do**

Every contribution helps -- whether it's fixing a typo in the documentation or adding an entire new feature. Often it's a good idea to start by fixing a smaller issue to get familiar with the process. If you don't know where to start, you can look at the `issue tracker <https://github.com/nighres/nighres/issues>`_.

**Git/Github**

To contribute you will need to know some basics about git and Github, which are not covered in this guide. There are lots of tutorials online (e.g. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials, especially "Getting started" and "Collaborating")

**Questions?**

For specifics about code you want to contribute :ref:`make-pr` is a great way to start a discussion and get input. Otherwise, you can post a question on `neurostars.org <https://neurostars.org>`_. Please use the tag **nighres** for your question.

**Ready to go?**

The next pages will take you through the steps you need from cloning the Nighres repository, to making a pull request.

.. note:: Help us improve this developer's guide! If you find anything unclear or not covered, open an `issue on github <https://github.com/nighres/nighres/issues>`_ or add what you were missing (see :ref:`adapt-docs`)
